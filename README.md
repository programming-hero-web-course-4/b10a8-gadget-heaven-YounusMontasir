## Technologies and Concepts Used
This project utilizes several fundamental React concepts and libraries to handle data, manage state, and provide a smooth user interface:

1. **React Hooks**
   - `useState`: For managing component-level state.
   - `useEffect`: For handling side effects in functional components.
   - `useLocation`: For detecting the current route and updating UI elements conditionally.
   - `useLoaderData`: For loading data specific to certain routes.

2. **Context API**  
   Used for handling and managing global data, such as user-selected products for the cart and wishlist, to make data accessible across multiple components.

3. **React Toastify**  
   Displays toast notifications based on user interactions, enhancing the feedback and interactivity of the app.

4. **React Helmet**  
   Dynamically updates the websiteâ€™s title based on the current route, improving the user experience and SEO.
